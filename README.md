# Hello-JavaScript
My adventure learning all things JavaScript!

This is the start of what will become a learning process spanning a variety of different programming languages as i prepare for my Master's thesis. The goal of this project is to familiarise myself with different programming languages, starting off with basic data structures and algorithms, and finishing off with a development task for each language.
