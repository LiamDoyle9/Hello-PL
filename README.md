# Hello, JavaScript!


The *Hello, \<Programming Language\>* series is an individual learning project to help familiarise myself with a variety of different programming languages. I will be exploring some data structures and algorithms from each language before attempting a programming challenge for each of the languages that have been explored. I have no intention of sharing / distributing this project with other parties, it is merely a fun little project to help with my own learning. <br>
